The "new curriculum committee proposal" recommended the formation of a new mega-Committee on Instruction that would oversee large curricular decisions across Arts and Sciences. In this early version, the COI would not have been chaired by a faculty member, but rather would have been chaired jointly by the <span class="g-cstyle4">College dean</span> and <span class="g-cstyle5">dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences</span>&mdash;a more similar construction to the current Executive Committee.</p> </div> <div id="g-ai2-5" class="g-aiAbs g-Layer_1" style="top:47.3201%;left:69.0565%;width:29%;"> <p class="g-pstyle1">On Feb. 20, at the second to last meeting of the task force, an initial draft of recommendations that had been compiled by the Office of the President, with input from task force members and including the new COI proposal from the faculty, was debated. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="g-pstyle1">One notable section of the draft allowed for the newly formed dean of Arts and Sciences to, along with the provost, be part of the president's determination of the salary of the College dean. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="g-pstyle1">This initial draft was <span class="g-cstyle6">poorly received</span> by a number of members, including Barnard President Sian Beilock; Thomas Cornacchia, a prominent financier and a member of the College BOV; and Brian Krisberg, a lawyer and former CCAA and CAA leader. At the meeting, Bollinger acknowledged the need for further meetings and another draft.</p> </div> <div id="g-ai2-6" class="g-aiAbs g-Layer_1" style="top:62.018%;left:11.0215%;width:76.6667%;"> <p>The final draft of the recommendations was distributed to task force members electronically on March 30, with a request to share feedback by April 4. The final report, which incorporated edits from several members, was sent to the entire task force on April 6, and made publicly available on April 8. </p> </div> <div id="g-ai2-7" class="g-aiAbs g-Layer_1" style="top:73.7046%;left:11.0215%;width:76.6667%;"> <p>The final version pulls back from some of the changes proposed in the Feb. 20 draft by <span class="g-cstyle7">keeping the College dean at the center of admissions and financial aid discussions </span>(although in the current construction of authority, the dean must already make enrollment decisions in conjunction with the executive vice president of Arts and Sciences, along with the provost and the executive vice president for finance).</p> </div> <div id="g-ai2-8" class="g-aiAbs g-Layer_1" style="top:78.0065%;left:3.8843%;width:27.6667%;"> <p class="g-pstyle1">Most notably, the final report punts on how to reconfigure the budgetary relationship between Arts and Sciences and the College, instead recommending the creation of a working group, which will center the new College dean and "examine budgetary challenges" over the next year. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="g-pstyle1">The Feb. 20 document was <span class="g-cstyle8">much more radical</span>&mdash;it even suggested a structure that would "centralize all development activities through Arts and Sciences and relieve the College of any responsibility to fundraise for its current-use budget."</p> </div> <div id="g-ai2-9" class="g-aiAbs g-Layer_1" style="top:94.8553%;left:12.8862%;width:76.6667%;"> <p class="g-pstyle2">One task force member took issue with the final recommendations. In a blistering six-page opinion, Brian Krisberg, CC &rsquo;81, Law &rsquo;84, dressed down the entire process, <span class="g-cstyle9">raising concerns about substance and process</span>. He claimed the changes would "diminish authority significantly" of the College dean. Although his dissent was sent to the Policy and Planning Committee by the President's Office, the primary faculty governance body within Arts and Sciences, it was not distributed to the entire faculty along with the final report on April 11.</p> </div> </div> </div>  </div> <div class="footer g-body"> <div class="article-credits"> <p> Produced with <a href="https://github.com/graphicsdesk/spectate">Spectate</a> by the <a href="https://graphicsdesk.github.io">Spectator Graphics</a> team. </p> </div> </div> <script src="script.75da7f30.js"></script> </body></html>
