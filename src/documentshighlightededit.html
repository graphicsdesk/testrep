			<p>The final draft of the recommendations was distributed to task force members electronically on March 30, with a request to share feedback by April 4. The final report, which incorporated edits from several members, was sent to the entire task force on April 6, and made publicly available on April 8. </p>

			<p>The final version pulls back from some of the changes proposed in the Feb. 20 draft by <span class="g-cstyle7">keeping the College dean at the center of admissions and financial aid discussions </span>(although in the current construction of authority, the dean must already make enrollment decisions in conjunction with the executive vice president of Arts and Sciences, along with the provost and the executive vice president for finance).</p>

			<p class="g-pstyle1">Most notably, the final report punts on how to reconfigure the budgetary relationship between Arts and Sciences and the College, instead recommending the creation of a working group, which will center the new College dean and "examine budgetary challenges" over the next year. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="g-pstyle1">The Feb. 20 document was <span class="g-cstyle8">much more radical</span>&mdash;it even suggested a structure that would "centralize all development activities through Arts and Sciences and relieve the College of any responsibility to fundraise for its current-use budget."</p>

			<p class="g-pstyle2">One task force member took issue with the final recommendations. In a blistering six-page opinion, Brian Krisberg, CC &rsquo;81, Law &rsquo;84, dressed down the entire process, <span class="g-cstyle9">raising concerns about substance and process</span>. He claimed the changes would "diminish authority significantly" of the College dean. Although his dissent was sent to the Policy and Planning Committee by the President's Office, the primary faculty governance body within Arts and Sciences, it was not distributed to the entire faculty along with the final report on April 11.</p>
